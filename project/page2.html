                <h2>Baroque Period (1600-1750)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Baroque period is the start of the classical music era. This style dominated for over a century, and composers highly emphasized the use of layered melodies (counterpoint technique), as well as the dramatic contrasts of emotions. Although the piano was not invented until the early 1700s, many harpsichord compositions were later adapted to the piano, which established the foundation of the classical piano repertoire.
                </p>
                <p>The Baroque era happened during the absolute rule of European Monarchies and the Scientific Revolution. During this period of time, music primarily serve to entertain nobility courts and religious worship, many composers who did not came from well off families would seek to be employed by churches or nobility, which allow them to fully focus in composing without worring about their livelihood.</p>
