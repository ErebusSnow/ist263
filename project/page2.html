                <h2>Baroque Period (1600-1750)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Baroque period is the start of the classical music era. This style dominated for over a century, and composers highly emphasized the use of layered melodies (counterpoint technique), as well as the dramatic contrasts of emotions. Although the piano was not invented until the early 1700s, many harpsichord compositions were later adapted to the piano, which established the foundation of the classical piano repertoire.
                </p>
                <p>The Baroque era happened during the absolute rule of European Monarchies and the Scientific Revolution. During this period of time, music primarily served to entertain nobility courts and religious worship. Many composers who did not come from well off families would seek to be employed by churches or nobility, which allowed them to fully focus on composing without worrying about their livelihood.</p>

                        <h3>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)</h3>
                        <p>He was a German composer who was largely unknown as a composer during his lifetime. He mastered counterpoint and harmonic complexity. He was born into a musical family, and held positions in Weimar and Leipzig. At his time there he created multiple works that in modern times represent the pinnacle of the Baroque period. His works like "The Art of Fugue" show his mastery in counterpoint technique, his Well-Tempered Clavier established an equal temperament tuning, while the Goldberg Variations showcase its beautiful and simple Aria.</p>

                        <p>He was a German composer that later on settled in England. He was famous for his oratorios and operas. His famous works include "Harmonious Blacksmith" variations, "Messiah," "Water Music," and other numerous suites that blend German counterpoint and Italian melody. Despite going blind later on, he kept composing through his assistants. He blended different European styles together creating an incredible power and drama that to this day still gives chills.</p>

                        <p>He was an Italian composer who served the Portuguese and Spanish royalty. Throughout his lifetime, he wrote 500 single-movement sonatas that illustrate technical innovation and Iberian folk influence. His works are like a diary of musical exploration that pushed the harpsichord to its limit with its fiery hand-crossing, rapid repeat notes, and daring harmonies. Pieces like Sonata in D minor K.141 and Sonata in A minor No. 7 showcase his brilliant composition that foreshadowed the Classical era techniques.</p>

                <h2>Classical Period (1750-1820)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Classical period emerged as a way to react against the Baroque's complexity, emphasizing balance and elegant form. In this period, the piano began replacing the harpsichord as the primary keyboard instrument, with composers developing sonata forms and establishing the symphony, concerto, and string quartet.
                </p>
                <p>This period aligned with the American and French Revolutions, as well as the rise of the middle class. Public concerts became more frequent and composers began working independently rather than just serving nobility.</p>

                        <p>He was an Austrian child prodigy who composed over 600 works across all genres in his lifetime. He created his first composition at the age of 5, Adante in C, and performed in front of European royalty as a child. His piano concertos represent some of the finest blends of virtuosity and musical expression. Despite dying at 35, his works like Piano Sonata No. 11, Symphony No. 40, and Minuet in F major No. 11 remain as some of the most prominent classical repertoire in modern times.</p>

                <h2>Romantic Period (1820-1900)</h2>
                <p>
                    This period is one of the most known in present time, due to being the start when composers started to break ways from the norm. In this period, most works have an intense emotional expression like pain, beauty, despair or love. It is also known for its wonderful virtuosity, and the creation of various branches of classical music like rhapsody or nocturne. This is one of the most used periods in any instrumental repertoire as it allows musicians to express themselves and evoke emotion towards the audience through different techniques or methods.

                <h2>The Modern Period (1900-Present)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Modern period is when composers completely broke the rules of classical music and started experimenting with other genres. The piano continues to adapt to new styles and technologies, one of the creations being the MIDI keyboard. Most modern songs' parts are composed with piano and later adapted to synth, string or other instruments.
