<h1>Kelvin Zorrilla Burgos - BIO</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Kelvin Zorrilla Burgos. I'm currently majoring as Information Management & Technology with a concentration in Project Management, and minor on Business. What I like about my major is creating something such as a web or application out of nothing, but at the same time I feel that I should pursue this as a hobby more than just a career. </p>

<p> <strong>Accomplishments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Have been on the Dean list since Fall 2022 (Freshman year)</li> 
<li>Self teaching myself how to play piano and learn French from scratch </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> <strong>Skills:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Music Production </li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Event Management</li>
<li>Time Management</li>
<li>Presentation Skills</li>
<li>Organizational skills </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Outside of work and school, I like doing various types of hobbies such as ice skating, rock climbing, football (soccer), basketball, tennis, chess, and music production. Some of my favorites Tv shows, movies, or books are Money Heist, YOU! (Netflix), Queen Gambit, and Harry Potter movies. A fun fact about me is that I lived in Madrid, Spain for 10 years before coming back to the United States, and I like to play the piano and learning new languages, although I don't know much I do enjoy teaching myself. </p>
