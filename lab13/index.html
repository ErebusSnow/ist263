    <h1>Kelvin Zorrilla Burgos - BIO</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Kelvin Zorrilla Burgos. I'm currently majoring in Information Management & Technology with a concentration in Project Management, and a minor in Business. What I like about my major is creating something—such as a website or application—from nothing. At the same time, I feel that I should pursue this as a hobby more than a career.</p>

    <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On the Dean's List since Fall 2022</li>
        <li>Self-teaching piano and French from scratch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Music Production</li>
        <li>Leadership</li>
        <li>Event Management</li>
        <li>Time Management</li>
        <li>Presentation Skills</li>
        <li>Organizational Skills</li>
        <li>Teamwork skills</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy various hobbies such as ice skating, rock climbing, soccer, basketball, tennis, chess, and music production. Some of my favorite TV shows, movies, and books include Money Heist, YOU! (Netflix), The Queen’s Gambit, and the Harry Potter movies. A fun fact about me is that I lived in Madrid, Spain for 10 years before returning to the United States.</p>
